# Tracking the enemy: analysing the SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequencing scenario in Brazil from GISAID data

Nucleic acids are biomolecules very important for life because they are involved in the process of how and when biological information (e.g. our eyes color) is stored, expressed, and trasnmited to the next generations.
Since the scientific community discovered these molecules (also called DNA and RNA, which are abbreviations you probalily heard sometime in your life) are so critical for living forms on the Earth, much attention has been turned to them. Even virus (like the SARS-CoV-2, the virus that is causing the pandemic we are living) has its own nucleic acid. Thus, we can infer that knowing the sequence (beacuse nucleic acids are composed of nucleotides sequences, known as nucleotides, like buildblocs) is very helpful to know at least in part this enemy. The whole DNA or RNA sequence of an organism is called genome and the field that study it and do a lot of other things whith these big sequences is named Genomics.
Many countries, since the pandemic started have done strong efforts to sequence the SARS-CoV-2 genome. For instance (and this is indeed the best example), United Kingdom has sequenced more than 600,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes[1]. Knowing the enemy that is making a government's country impose three lockdowns, causing more than 120,000 deaths and impacting strongly the economy [2] is essential.

## Objectives
That said, I aim to analyse Brazil genomic sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 scenario and hence:
- how this process is happening in a country of continetal dimensions
- the differences between the years 2020 and 2021
- examples of how this has helped the health authorites to design public policies in the pandemic's context
- the importance of metadata when talking about "genomic surveillance"

## Methods
All data used in this work was extracted from GISAID (LINK HERE). But genomic sequences (which has not been analyzed here) and metadata are provided by a wide range of laboratories throughout Brazil. The analysis - data cleaning, data handling, and plot building - was perfomed in Google Collab, using the Pyhton language. numbers about cases were retrieved from [link here]

## Results
